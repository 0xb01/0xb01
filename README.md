## ðŸš€ About Me
Welcome, I'm Niks , an android developer / software and hardware programmer / virus analyst from the Philippines. My interests range from photography to technology. I am also interested in the 30s to 90s music, and dogs. I've done voluntary work, funded children for school and indigenous people for shelter and supplies.
